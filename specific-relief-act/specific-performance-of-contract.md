# Specific Performance of Contract

{% hint style="success" %}
**UPHJS2016 Q.4\(B\) 'X' a real estate agent due to his proximity with the Ruling Party comes to know that a highway is being laid from the village concerned, and persuades 'A', the tenure holder, to enter into a contract for sale of his substantial land on 1-1-2010 at the rate or Rs. 10,000/- per bigha as the earnest money. The sale was to be executed within a year. 'A' died on 10-10-2010. The road project is inaugurated on 1-11-2010. 'X' files a suit for specific performance of contract against 'B', only heir of 'A' on 20-12-2010, with the allegation that he was and is willing to perform his part of the contract, and that a notice was previously sent to 'A' to execute sale deed on 30-8-2010. Suit is contested on the ground that it was not entered into between the parties, and that due to changed circumstances, prices of land in the village have increased manifold, and would otherwise cause grave hardship for 'B', as it would virtually render him landless. It is also claimed that it would be inequitable to enforce the contract. Decide with reference to provisions of law and the authorities on the subject. \[20 marks\]**
