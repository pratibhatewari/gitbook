**UPHJS2016 Q.1\(c\) The suit for specific performance of contract filed by 'A' decreed \(exparte against 'B'.\) On getting information of the ex-parte decree, 'B' moved an application for setting aside the ex-parte decree. Subsequently, pending application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he also challenged the ex-parte decree by filing an appeal against the ex-parte decree, with an application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of Indian Limitation Act, claiming that the time of alleged execution of agreement for sale, he was minor and as the agreement for sale is null and void so also the decree for specific performance of contract. The application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure was dismissed by the trial court, in view of explanation inserted by Act No. 104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977 on account of filing of appeal. Subsequently, the appeal filed by 'B' was dismissed as barred by time.**

**Whether the trial court was right in dismissing the application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground of filing of appeal? Answer with reasons. \[10 marks\]**
