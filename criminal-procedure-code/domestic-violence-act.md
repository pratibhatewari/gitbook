**\(f\) Direct the 1st respondent to provide separate residence if required on rent.** 

**\(g\) Directing the respondent to return the original study certificates, medical certificates, deposits certificates and receipts etc.** 

**On behalf of the husband-opposite party, application was opposed on the ground that under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 magistrate had no power to allow amendment to a complaint/ application.**

**On behalf of the wife-complainant, it was submitted that the proceedings were civil in nature and provisions of Code of Civil Procedure would be applicable. Thus the court had jurisdiction. The court allowed the application accepting the argument advanced on behalf of the wife-complainant.**

**Appeal is preferred against the order passed by the magistrate. Has the learned magistrate committed any error in rejecting the objection raised on behalf of the husband or not? Give reasons in support of your opinion and refer the case law on this point. \[ 20 marks \]**
